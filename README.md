# ChatGPT-in-Academia

This repository provides insight to how undergraduate students, graduate students, and professors view the impact of ChatGPT in academia, researched by a group of 4 students at Toronto Metropolitan University. The method used to obtain this data was through a Google Form which gathered over 100 responses from a variety of individuals involved in academia. Using JupyterLab and python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy), we were able to visualize the data in forms of different types of graphs (Pie charts and Bar Graphs) to then make conclusions about how ChatGPT has influenced academia and how it should be used.

The overall consensus from this research project was that ChatGPT should be integrated into academia with precautions. The overall opinions about the use of ChatGPT from those who completed the survey varied between different Undergraduate and Graduate programs. For instance, those who were involved in more STEM related programs (Engineering, IT, Computer Science) were more keen on incorporating ChatGPT than those who were not from STEM related programs.

Currently in 2024, we can see clearly as to why those who are not from STEM programs want to move away from ChatGPT and AI in general is due to the fact that their future careers are at risk due to the recent advancements in AI. As a result, ChatGPT should be used sparingly for tasks that would benefit advancements in society as a whole rather than leaving society behind and letting AI take control.
